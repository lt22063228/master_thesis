  abstract = {Pair-wise ranking methods have been widely used in recommender systems to deal with implicit feedback. They attempt to discriminate between a handful of observed items and the large set of unobserved items. In these approaches, however, user preferences and item characteristics cannot be estimated reliably due to overfitting given highly sparse data. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework which incorporates ``bag-of-words'' type meta-data on items into pair-wise ranking models for one-class collaborative filtering. The main idea of our method lies in extending the pair-wise ranking with a probabilistic topic modeling. Instead of regularizing item factors through a zero-mean Gaussian prior, our method introduces item-specific topic proportions  as priors for item factors. As a by-product, interpretable latent factors for users and items may help explain recommendations in some applications. We conduct an experimental study on a real and publicly available dataset, and the results show that our algorithm is effective in providing accurate recommendation and interpreting user factors and item factors.},
